Test file for upload functionality
Created: 2025-08-02T02:32:24.969Z

This file tests the corrected upload path handling with the Git filing provider.

The issue was:
- Multer saves files with absolute paths
- Git filing provider expects relative paths  
- This caused path duplication in the form:
  /temp-content/temp-content/filename

The fix:
- Convert absolute temp file paths to relative paths
- Use path.relative(contentDir, tempFilePath)
- This ensures proper path resolution
